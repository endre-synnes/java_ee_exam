Description:

In my application I have created all the selenium tests you asked for. I have also implementet all funtionality you asked for
in both services and controllers.

I have an total of 94% code coverage.



To Run my application localy run class: LocalApplicationRunner

To Run all tests type: mvn clean verify in root folder.


Backend:

- I Have implemented functionality to delete books as well as creating new ones.

- All Users are identified by an unique email address.

- All Books have an ID but i have also created a constraint so that no books with the same title can exist at the same time.




Frontend:

- In the front end I have created all the selenium tests you asked for,
  but if I had more time i would have created som more dynamically tests.


Extra functionality:

- I Have added functionality for ADMIN users. A user can register as an admin and will then get access to an admin page.

- Admin users can create and delete books.

- When you shall send a message you are taken to a new page with a form so that i have one page for that and another for
  viewing all sent and received messages.

- I Have also deployed to Heroku.
